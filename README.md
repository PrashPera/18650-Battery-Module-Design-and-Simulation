# Robotic-Arm-Project
This project involves designing and building a robotic arm using SolidWorks for CAD and 3D printing. 
The arm is controlled via an Arduino, with Python scripts managing communication and commands. 
It integrates mechanical design, electronics, and software development for a comprehensive robotic system.
